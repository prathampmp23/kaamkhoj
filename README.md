# KaamKhoj - Voice-Enabled Job Portal for Blue-Collar Workers

KaamKhoj is a **voice-assisted job portal** developed to address the employment challenges faced by unskilled, illiterate, and semi-literate individuals in India. Unlike traditional job platforms that primarily cater to educated users, KaamKhoj focuses on empowering daily wage earners, migrant laborers, and blue-collar workers by providing an **AI-powered, voice-driven interface** accessible in Hindi and other regional languages.

## üéØ Problem Statement

A large segment of India‚Äôs workforce ‚Äî including domestic workers, daily wage earners, and migrant laborers ‚Äî struggles to access employment opportunities due to:
- **Language barriers** (most job portals are English-only)
- **Literacy limitations** (workers unable to create resumes or fill digital forms)
- **Digital illiteracy** (difficulty using complex apps/websites)
- **Lack of job visibility** for short-term, local, and daily wage work

## üí° Solution

KaamKhoj bridges this gap with an **inclusive, voice-first platform** that enables workers to:
1. **Register with Voice**: Speak in Hindi or regional languages to create a job profile (no typing or resumes required)  
2. **AI-Powered Job Matching**: NLP-driven matching of workers to suitable jobs based on trade skills, location, and availability  
3. **Voice-Based Job Search**: Search and apply for jobs through simple voice commands  
4. **SMS Notifications**: Get job alerts via SMS for users without smartphones or constant internet access  
5. **Employer-Friendly Portal**: Employers can post jobs directly and connect with verified workers quickly
