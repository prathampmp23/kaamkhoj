# KaamKhoj - A Job Matching Platform for Blue-Collar Workers

KaamKhoj is a comprehensive platform specifically designed to bridge the gap between blue-collar workers and potential employers. The application provides an intuitive, accessible interface available in multiple languages (Hindi and English) to ensure inclusivity for all users, particularly those from underserved communities with limited digital literacy and language barriers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In India and many developing countries, a significant portion of the workforce consists of blue-collar workers (carpenters, plumbers, electricians, construction workers, domestic help, etc.) who often struggle to find suitable employment opportunities. Traditional job portals and recruitment platforms are typically designed for white-collar professionals and completely overlook the unique needs of the blue-collar workforce. Key challenges include:

- Language barriers that prevent workers from accessing digital job platforms
- Lack of structured resume-building tools for workers with limited formal education
- Difficulty in matching available jobs with workers' skills and availability
- Limited digital literacy among potential users

1. **Multilingual Support**: Complete interface in Hindi and English, with easy language switching to serve blue-collar workers from diverse linguistic backgrounds
2. **Voice-Assisted Registration**: AI-powered voice interface that allows workers to register by simply speaking in their preferred language, eliminating literacy barriers
3. **Intelligent Job Matching**: Algorithm that matches blue-collar workers with suitable jobs based on trade skills, experience, location, and availability
